          Innosoft is committed to enforcing a workforce and supply chain free
          of human trafficking and all forms of forced labor and unlawful labor.
          We have a zero-tolerance policy surrounding modern slavery, which
          encompasses human trafficking, servitude, and forced labor. This
          policy is consistent with our core values and supports our compliance
          with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and all U.S. Government regulations
          regarding slavery, forced labor, and trafficking in persons. In
          compliance with these laws, Innosoft employees are trained and
          annually acknowledge they will uphold our Code of Ethics and Business
          Conduct.

          In compliance with Innosoft’s Policy Against Trafficking in Persons
          and Slavery and, by extension, the Modern Slavery Act 2015, Corporate
          Quality Assurance representatives perform independent reviews and/or
          audits to ensure procurement process compliance with U.S. Federal
          regulations. Our U.S. Federal vendors annually certify their
          compliance with the Supplier Representations and Certifications
          document, which includes compliance with laws on human trafficking and
          slavery in the country or countries in which the vendors do business.
          The Combating Trafficking in Persons clauses in U.S. Federal
          Acquisition Regulation 52.222-50 are incorporated into Innosoft
          subcontracts, as required, when doing business on behalf of U.S.
          Federal customers.{" "}

          In 2021, Innosoft will update our Purchase Order Standard Terms and
          Conditions and agreement templates to incorporate anti-human
          trafficking language for all subcontracts awarded in support of U.S.
          Federal work.
